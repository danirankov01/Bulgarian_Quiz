# Bulgarian_Quiz
Test your knowledge in Bulgarian landmarks
This is my first attempt to create a mobile app (failed unfortunately I couldn't run the .apk file from my phone). It's made with kivy language and some Python - the game has 10 questions that test how well we are familiar with our natural landmarks. The good news is that you can use the application from a computer. Try it and see how well you know our motherland.
